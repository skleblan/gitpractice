just had an idea
will create a separate branch for different users
each user works on separate branch
then merges in with master when at a stable point
user-branches need to remember to merge from master periodically
(or whenever another user merges into master)

other ideas
(taken)list of avengers members at the point of each avengers movie
(taken)list of xmen members at each movie
list of star wars characters
list of months in english and spanish
list of days of week in english and spanish
create stories in spanish to practice composition
(taken)list of presidents
list of roman emperors (as best as can remember)
list of pokemon
